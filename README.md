# GateKeeper
This program began in May 2018 and was created by Kenny Jarnagin & Graham Wood in the Mobile Application Development course at Hanover College (taught by Dr. Theresa Wilson). 
This repository is a continuation of that project. With some hard work, and a little bit of luck, this will become the app used by Hanover College's Greek life for signing in guests at social events.
This app will be able to scan school ids from Hanover College and pull up name/id # and enter it into a database (that will then be reported to the risk manager of the house operating the app). 
IDs not issued by Hanover College must be entered manually, including name, ID #, ID issuer, age of patron, and a photo of the patron (optional).
